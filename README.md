This is the Capstone project which is a part of my Data Science course at AlmaBetter.

Project Name :- Airbnb Booking Analysis Exploratory Data Analysis Project Summary Since 2008, guests and hosts have used Airbnb to expand on traveling possibilities and present a more unique, personalized way of experiencing the world. Today, Airbnb became one of a kind service that is used and recognized by the whole world. Data analysis on millions of listings provided through Airbnb is a crucial factor for the company. These millions of listings generate a lot of data - data that can be analyzed and used for security, business decisions, understanding of customers' and providers' (hosts) behavior and performance on the platform, guiding marketing initiatives, implementation of innovative additional services and much more.This dataset has around 49,000 observations in it with 16 columns and it is a mix between categorical and numeric values. Problem Statement For this project we are analyzing Airbnbâ€™s New York City(NYC) data of 2019. NYC is not only the most famous city in the world but also top global destination for visitors drawn to its museums, entertainment, restaurants and commerce. The objective of our exploratory data analysis (EDA) on Airbnb's 2019 New York City (NYC) dataset is to identify the key metrics that influence the listing of properties on the Airbnb platform. By applying basic EDA techniques, we aim to gain insights into the dataset and visualize its various attributes As NYC is the most famous city in the world and a top global destination, understanding the factors that impact property listings in this vibrant metropolis becomes crucial. Visitors are drawn to NYC for its renowned museums, entertainment options, diverse culinary experiences, and bustling commercial activities. Through our analysis, we seek to uncover valuable information about the distribution of Airbnb listings across different locations within NYC. We aim to explore price range, room types, listing names, and other relevant variables.
